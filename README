Compilation
===========

apt-get install tetex-bin tetex-extra

./make

this will create "groups.ps" and "groups.pdf" in the "tmp" directory.


Note:
-----

You can also install texlive instead of tetex, but the 
font generation doesn't work:

apt-get install texlive texlive-formats-extra texlive-generic-recommended
